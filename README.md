# AutoRepro
AutoRepro turns an Issue into clear repro steps and a shareable workspace. It auto-detects the repo stack, generates a ready devcontainer, and writes a prioritized Repro Plan (repro.md) with explicit assumptions. MVP commands: scan, init, plan (no execution). Roadmap: auto failing test + Draft PR.
