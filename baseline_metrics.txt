REFACTOR METRICS COMPARISON
===========================

BEFORE REFACTOR:
================
Lines of Code: 6282 total (autorepro module)
Cyclomatic Complexity: 162 blocks analyzed, Average complexity: A (4.52)

AFTER REFACTOR:
===============
Lines of Code: 6280 total (autorepro module) [-2 lines]
Cyclomatic Complexity: 162 blocks analyzed, Average complexity: A (4.52) [unchanged]

CHANGES MADE:
=============
1. Vulture Analysis & Cleanup:
   - Removed unused 'optional' parameter from validate_args function in decorators.py
   - Search validation: rg confirmed parameter was unused in function body
   - Evidence: https://github.com/ali90h/AutoRepro/vulture.txt

2. Ruff Anti-Inflation Warnings Enabled:
   - Added PLR0915 (too-many-statements), PLR0913 (too-many-arguments)
   - Added C901 (complex-structure), PLR0912 (too-many-branches)
   - Added PLR0911 (too-many-return-statements)
   - Status: Currently ignored (warnings phase), can be made errors later
   - Current violations: 43 across multiple files

3. Quality Assurance:
   - All golden tests pass (16/16) - CLI behavior unchanged
   - Full test suite: Ready for validation

TICKET #72 PROGRESS - Addressing 43 Ruff Violations:
===================================================

## Phase 1A: cmd_exec Function Refactor ✅ COMPLETED
### Target: Most Critical Function (5 violations)
**Function**: `cmd_exec` (cli.py:977) - 127 statements, 33 branches, complexity 30

**Violations Eliminated**:
- ✅ C901: Complex structure (30 → 8)
- ✅ PLR0915: Too many statements (127 → 30)
- ✅ PLR0912: Too many branches (33 → 8)

**Remaining violations** (acceptable for now):
- PLR0913: Too many arguments (12 > 5) - kept for backward compatibility
- PLR0911: Too many return statements (8 > 6) - early returns for error handling

**Refactoring Strategy Applied**:
1. Created ExecConfig dataclass to group 12 parameters
2. Extracted 8 focused helper functions:
   - Repository validation, input reading, suggestion generation
   - Command selection, environment setup, execution, output logging
3. Simplified main function to clean, linear flow

**Quality Verification**:
- All 13/13 exec CLI tests pass - Functionality preserved
- All 16/16 golden tests pass - CLI behavior unchanged
- MyPy type checking passes

**Overall Progress**: 43 → 40 violations (-7% reduction, -3 critical violations)

## Next Phases Planned:
- Phase 1B: _generate_plan_content (3 violations)
- Phase 1C: maybe_exec (4 violations)
- Phase 2: High-argument functions cleanup
