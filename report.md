# AutoRepro Project Development Report

## Project Overview
AutoRepro is a developer tools project that transforms issue descriptions into clear reproducibility steps and a shareable framework. The project automatically detects repository technologies, generates ready-made devcontainers, and writes prioritized repro plans.

### MVP Scope
- **scan**: Detect languages/frameworks from file pointers
- **init**: Create an installer devcontainer
- **plan**: Derive execution plan from issue description (no execution)

### Long-term Vision
- Auto-generate failing tests
- Open Draft PRs containing reproducible tests
- Improve contribution quality and maintenance speed on GitHub

## Development Timeline

### Task 0: Project Bootstrap (CLI Skeleton + Tests + CI)
**Status**: âœ… Completed
**Started**: August 15, 2025
**Completed**: August 15, 2025
**PR**: https://github.com/ali90h/AutoRepro/pull/1
**Objective**: Set up complete Python project foundation with CLI interface, testing, and CI/CD

#### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Python Version**: 3.11 (project requirement)
- **CLI Framework**: argparse (standard library, lightweight)
- **Package Structure**: Flat autorepro/ layout
- **Build Tool**: pyproject.toml (modern Python standard)
- **Testing**: pytest with CLI behavior verification
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Python 3.11 on ubuntu-latest

#### File Structure Created:
```

#### Current CLI Output:
```
usage: autorepro [-h] [--version]

CLI for AutoRepro - transforms issues into repro steps

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --version   show program's version number and exit

AutoRepro automatically detects repository technologies, generates ready-made
devcontainers, and writes prioritized repro plans with explicit assumptions.

MVP commands (coming soon):
  scan    Detect languages/frameworks from file pointers

## Development Notes

### Design Philosophy:
- **Simplicity**: Start with minimal viable implementation
- **Transparency**: Clear command outputs and error messages
- **Automation**: Reduce manual reproduction steps
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports future MVP commands

### Code Quality Standards:
- Modern Python packaging (pyproject.toml)
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- CI/CD automation
- Proper git workflow with PR reviews

---

### Pre-commit Installation Issue Resolution (August 16, 2025)
**Status**: âœ… Completed
**Issue**: Pre-commit hooks installation failure and code formatting conflicts

#### Problems Identified:
1. **Git hooks path conflict**: Global `core.hooksPath` setting prevented pre-commit installation
2. **Line length mismatch**: Black/Ruff used 100 chars, flake8 defaulted to 79 chars

#### Resolution:
1. **Removed global git hooks path**: `git config --global --unset-all core.hooksPath`
2. **Created `.flake8` configuration**: Set max-line-length to 100 to match other tools
3. **Successfully installed pre-commit hooks**: All tools now pass validation

#### Technical Details:
- Flake8 doesn't support pyproject.toml natively, requiring separate `.flake8` config
- Unified 100-character line length across all formatting tools (black, ruff, flake8)
- Pre-commit hooks now active for automatic code quality enforcement

#### Current Tool Configuration:
- **Black**: 100 chars (pyproject.toml)
- **Ruff**: 100 chars (pyproject.toml)
- **Flake8**: 100 chars (.flake8 file)
- **Pre-commit**: Installed and functional

### CI Pre-commit Hook Failure Analysis (August 16, 2025)
**Status**: ğŸ”§ Patch Proposed
**Issue**: GitHub Actions CI failing due to yanked `types-pkg-resources` dependency in mypy hook

#### Root Cause Analysis:
The mypy pre-commit hook was configured with `additional_dependencies: [types-all]`, which depends on `types-pkg-resources`. This package was yanked from PyPI in August 2024 with the message "Use types-setuptools instead," causing installation failures during hook environment setup.

#### Error Details:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement types-pkg-resources (from types-all)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for types-pkg-resources
```

#### Investigation Findings:
1. **Yanked Package**: `types-pkg-resources` was removed from PyPI as part of setuptools integration improvements
2. **Project Scope**: AutoRepro is a simple CLI tool using only standard library modules (argparse, sys)
3. **Unnecessary Dependency**: `types-all` provides external type stubs not needed for this project
4. **Missing CI Step**: Pre-commit hooks weren't validated in CI workflow

#### Proposed Solution (Minimal Patch):
```diff
# Remove problematic dependency from .pre-commit-config.yaml
- additional_dependencies: [types-all]

# Add pre-commit validation to CI workflow
+ - name: Run pre-commit hooks
+   run: |
+     pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Rationale:
- **Minimal & Reversible**: Simple removal rather than complex dependency replacement
- **Sufficient Scope**: Standard library type checking doesn't require external type stubs
- **Preventive**: CI integration catches similar issues early
- **Maintains Quality**: mypy still provides valuable type checking without external stubs

#### Technical Context:
- `pkg_resources` types are now included in setuptools directly (â‰¥71.1)
- Modern Python projects migrate from `pkg_resources` to `importlib.resources/metadata`
- `types-all` was a transitional package that's no longer necessary for simple projects

#### Patch Applied (August 16, 2025):
**Files Modified**:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Removed `additional_dependencies: [types-all]` from mypy hook
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Added pre-commit validation step after dependency installation

**Summary**: Applied minimal fix to resolve yanked dependency issue while maintaining type checking capabilities. The removed `types-all` dependency was unnecessary for this standard library CLI project.

**Rationale**: Eliminates CI failure root cause without complex replacements, adds preventive CI validation, and maintains code quality standards. Solution is reversible if future type stub requirements emerge.

### Scan Command Implementation (August 16, 2025)
**Status**: ğŸ”§ Patch Proposed
**Feature**: Implement `autorepro scan` command with detection reasons

#### Implementation Overview:
Created a complete language detection system that identifies technologies based on file patterns and provides explicit reasons for each detection.

#### New Files Created:
- **`autorepro/detect.py`**: Core detection logic with `detect_languages()` API
- **`tests/test_detect.py`**: Comprehensive tests for detection logic (10 test cases)
- **`tests/test_scan_cli.py`**: CLI integration tests (6 test cases)

#### Modified Files:
- **`autorepro/cli.py`**: Added subcommand support and `scan` command implementation
- **`README.md`**: Updated with scan command documentation and examples

#### API Design:
```python
def detect_languages(path: str) -> List[Tuple[str, List[str]]]
```
- **Pure function**: No side effects, returns structured data
- **Deterministic ordering**: Languages and reasons sorted alphabetically
- **Root-only scanning**: Non-recursive directory scanning
- **Mixed pattern support**: Both exact filenames and glob patterns

#### Supported Languages:
- **Python**: `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `*.py`
- **Node.js**: `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- **Go**: `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `*.go`
- **Rust**: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `*.rs`
- **Java**: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `*.java`
- **C#**: `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, `*.cs`

#### CLI Output Format:
```bash
$ autorepro scan
Detected: node, python
- node  -> package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml
- python  -> pyproject.toml, requirements.txt
```

#### Technical Decisions:
- **Alphabetical ordering**: Ensures deterministic, predictable output
- **Exact vs glob patterns**: Handles both `pyproject.toml` (exact) and `*.py` (glob) patterns
- **Basename collection**: For globs, collects actual matched filenames, not patterns
- **Pure function design**: Detection logic is testable and reusable
- **Comprehensive testing**: 16 total test cases covering edge cases and CLI integration

#### Branch Strategy:
- **Target branch**: `feat/scan-reasons`
- **Feature scope**: Complete scan command implementation
- **Testing coverage**: Unit tests for detection logic + CLI integration tests
